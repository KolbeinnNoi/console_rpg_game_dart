entrance hallway:

dim lighting, creaky floorboards.
a coat rack with a single dripping wet coat (it’s not raining).
whispers or faint breathing as players move forward.
clue etched on the mirror by the door: “you’ll need what’s broken to leave.”
tv room (left):

static-filled tv that turns off when approached. turn it back on, and you see distorted images of the house.
creepy doll sitting on the couch, staring at the tv.
puzzle: players need to tune the tv to a specific channel to reveal a number or phrase. the dial keeps skipping the correct station until they solve another room’s puzzle.
fake scare: a shadow moves in the corner of the screen.
kitchen (right):

bloodied cutting board and a knife stuck in the table—knife is needed for a later puzzle.
fridge hums loudly, then suddenly stops when opened. inside: rotten food and a severed hand clutching a key.
stove burners turn on randomly, spooking players.
locked pantry: opens later to reveal… something unpleasant.
long dark hallway:

dripping sound with no visible source.
occasional loud bangs from the doors as they pass.
faint shadow figures that flicker out of existence when approached.
first door (straight ahead):

small room with a decayed bed.
painting on the wall with eyes that follow players.
hidden drawer contains a cryptic note: “left is right, but right leads to ruin.”
left door:

storage room packed with old furniture and crates.
puzzle: players need to clear debris to find an item (e.g., crowbar or screwdriver).
faint crying that stops abruptly when investigated.
right door (staircase):

staircase is barely lit; feels precarious.
as players approach, a loud sound like someone running upstairs occurs, but no one is there.
ghostly face appears briefly in the window above the stairs.
second straight door (past stairs):

large, empty dining room with a long table.
chairs are overturned, and a single plate sits at the head of the table.
puzzle: place the knife from the kitchen and the key from the fridge on the plate to unlock a secret compartment.
left door (from dining room):

a bathroom with a shattered mirror.
message written on the bathroom wall in reverse (must be read via mirror fragment): “it ends in the dark.”
bathtub fills with blood if players stay too long.
right door (from dining room):

closet-sized space with a rocking chair.
chair rocks slowly when approached but stops suddenly if players linger.
item: a piece of paper with half a symbol drawn.
overall note:

scatter clues and scares to create a cohesive narrative—something happened in this house that players are piecing together.
balance safe exploration areas with high-tension zones to keep players on edge.
make sure progression flows: items from one room unlock or solve puzzles in others.
this setup should give a spooky and interactive vibe with plenty of WTF moments.






















ok, the haunted house concept fits perfectly into the console rpg requirements from the assignment:

difficulty level:

keep it moderate for the 80% requirement: navigation, interactions, and one locked door needing a key.
ramp up for the extra 20% by adding traps and puzzles.
what to implement rn:

navigation between rooms with clear descriptions.
room-specific interactions: "pick up", "move", "break", "use".
at least one locked door requiring the player to search other rooms for a key.
bonus features for the 20%:

trap room: make a room with a dangerous event (e.g., spikes) and require an item (e.g., a shield) to bypass.
puzzle room: use clues hidden in earlier rooms. something like a code from a diary or book to unlock a safe.
optional ASCII art for style points (employ simple graphics for room layouts).
how hard it should be:
navigation and keyfinding: straightforward but forces exploration. place misleading clues/items to fake complexity.
trap and puzzle: make the trap solvable with logic (no RNG bs) and the puzzle require prior notes from earlier rooms.
aim for players to fail or restart a couple of times but not ragequit.
focus on clean code readability + docs too bc that’s like 50% of your grade lol.
