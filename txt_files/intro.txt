You're on your usual evening walk, the air sharp and cold, when a sudden scream cuts through the silence. It’s coming from a house you’ve never seen before... a house that feels off, like it doesn’t belong here.

You step closer, your gut twisting. As you knock, the door creaks open on its own. A chill spills out from the darkness inside, pulling you forward.

The moment you step inside, the door SLAMS shut behind you. Startled, you spin around. It’s gone—replaced by a blank wall.

Your heart races. You shout for help, but the house swallows your voice. The scream? Gone. Silence presses in, broken only by the faint flicker of a single dim bulb.
