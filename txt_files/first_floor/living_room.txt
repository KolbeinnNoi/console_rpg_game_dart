you find yourself in what appears to be a dimly lit living room. to your left, 
there's a worn sofa facing a tv displaying only white static, its faint crackling sound filling the air.
to your right, an archway leads into what seems to be a kitchen.
directly ahead, a pitch-dark hallway stretches into the unknown.
