As you step into the dark hallway, the air grows colder with every step, 
and an unrelenting sense of dread begins to weigh on you.

The dim light reveals faded symbols carved into the walls. Upon closer inspection, the symbols appear to be scattered: 
- A **triangle (▲)** is etched on the left wall near the beginning of the hallway.
- A **circle (●)** is faintly drawn on the floor in the middle of the hallway.
- A **square (■)** is carved into the ceiling right above you.

A faint rustling sound comes from the shadows ahead. It feels as if something is waiting, just out of sight, beyond the symbols.
