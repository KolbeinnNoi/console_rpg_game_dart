As you open the door, a horrible smell hits you. Inside, you see various items scattered around. 
There are some rotten vegetables, a carton of spoiled milk, 
and a few containers with moldy leftovers.
Among the items, you notice something dead - a small animal, perhaps a rat, lying lifeless on one of the shelves. 
In the back of the fridge, there is a lockbox, partially hidden behind some old jars. The stench is overwhelming, making it hard to stay near the fridge for too long.
