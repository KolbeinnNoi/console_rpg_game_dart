The lockbox is old and rusted, but the mechanism on it looks sturdy. A small, faded label on the side reads: "Do not open."

The lock features four rotating dials, each marked with numbers from 0 to 9. The mechanism clicks faintly as you turn the dials, hinting at the need for a 4-digit code to unlock..

There should be clues around the house to help you open the lockbox
