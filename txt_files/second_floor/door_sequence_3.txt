The final set of doors looms before you. A faint sound of whispers fills the air. Each door bears a final set of symbols and clues:

- **Door 1:** A symbol of a star. Above it reads: "The guiding light shows the path."
- **Door 2:** A symbol of a spiral. Above it reads: "Spirals pull you deeper, never to return."
- **Door 3:** A symbol of a sword. Above it reads: "The sharp path leaves no survivors."
