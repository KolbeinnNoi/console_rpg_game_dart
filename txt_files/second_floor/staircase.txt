As you walk up the staircase, you notice a piece of parchment pinned to the wall. 
The handwriting is old and faint:

"Only water quenches the flames.  
The roots of wisdom dig deep.  
A guiding star lights the way."

You carefully read the note before continuing up the stairs.

At the top, you find yourself in a chamber unlike anything you've
seen before... a vast, hollow space lined with what looks like
polished obsidian. The walls shimmer faintly, as if alive, reflecting
strange, distorted versions of yourself. Ahead are three doors, each
marked with a cryptic symbol and a short phrase above it. The phrases
might hold the key to your survival.
