You pass through the first door and find another set of three. The air feels heavier, and the stakes even higher. The doors bear new symbols:

- **Door 1:** A symbol of a tree. Above it reads: "The roots of truth dig deep."
- **Door 2:** A symbol of a clock. Above it reads: "Timeâ€™s hands may lead astray."
- **Door 3:** A symbol of a snake. Above it reads: "Fangs hide in the quiet shadows."
