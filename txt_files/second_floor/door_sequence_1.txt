You stand before the first set of three doors. Each door bears a unique symbol, and above each is a short phrase:

- **Door 1:** A symbol of a flame. Above it reads: "Flames illuminate, but they also consume."
- **Door 2:** A symbol of a drop of water. Above it reads: "Cool waters reveal what burns cannot."
- **Door 3:** A symbol of a mountain. Above it reads: "The higher you climb, the harder you fall."

The choice is yours. Choose wisely.
